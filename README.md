# Avoiding-Curtailments-through-Green-H2-and-NH3-production
This is a glimpse into my Diploma Thesis, where I utilised a forecasted dataset of renewable energy production and different curtailment scenarios to produce Green Hydrogen and Ammonia with the purpose of being used in shipping.

##Abstract

The increasing installed capacity of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) leads to higher levels of energy curtailment to ensure grid stability. This excess energy can be utilized to produce hydrogen, which can subsequently be converted into ammonia for use in maritime applications. Based on simulations of installed capacity and curtailment levels, a green ammonia production plant is dimensioned, optimizing the electrolyzer size to maximize profitability while maintaining a viable capacity factor. Seven (7) curtailment scenarios and three (3) ammonia price scenarios are analyzed. The results demonstrate the economic feasibility of the investment and the competitiveness of the Levelized Cost of Ammonia (LCOA). Furthermore, annual green ammonia production ranges between 10 and 70 thousand tonnes, depending on the curtailment intensity. This production level is sufficient to support maritime fuel demand, while a seven-day storage system ensures steady supply and operational stability. Overall, the findings present green ammonia as a realistic pathway for maritime decarbonization, emphasizing the opportunity to harness otherwise curtailed renewable energy for value-added fuel production.
